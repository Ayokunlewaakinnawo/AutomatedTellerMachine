# AutomatedTellerMachine
This algorithm is designed to intricately show a transaction on an automated teller machine(ATM) .

Given that the user performing this ATM operation has a checking account type with the bank of America and also has a total 
account balance of $650 .
(HINT: Pin code to access this account is 1234)
Also, within a single transaction (the point in which the user card is inserted to when the user entirely completes his/her 
transaction), the user should be able to not only perform a withdrawal transaction, but also check account balance and make 
changes to the 4 digit pin code that is updated to be the new pin to access the account when performing another looped 
transaction.
